INTRODUCTION
=========

The Mapping Protocol provides individuals on the DSensor network the ability to propose Scientific theories called MNMs (Mapping Network Methods). MNM are put to the network that then responds with a consensus on that being true and over time the best Methods would become Computationally Active. Consensus is based on the best understanding of reality that the network has based on sensor data incentivised economically to participate in knowledge sharing, creation and application. In short, this equates to 'programmable science'.


CORE FUNCTIONS
===========

The Mapping Protocol governs the consensus on what scientific network computations are valid and active on any individual Resolution Client.


FUNCTIONS OF PROTOCOL

=========================

Aggregate consensus across the network

"Score" Mapping Network Methods for:

- Prediction Path accuracy
- Complexity of code
- context

Creates mapping accounting audit trail

Manages access to data and CPU resources

Keeps Mappers (those putting forth scientific methods) honest via technical and economic incentive mechanisms:

- random sampler mechanism
- proof of data
- proof of computation


CONTRIBUTE
========

The project is at an early stage of evolution so all are welcome to join in.  Create the rules governing the project from the start.
